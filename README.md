### This project is still under development. Features and documentation are subject to change.

### Overview

Goal of **Fresh Near Me** is to connect consumers directly with local producers, making it easy for everyone to access and enjoy fresh, locally-grown food. This platform is about supporting local communities and promoting healthier, sustainable food choices.

### Why fresh near me?
Michigan State University [article](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/seven-benefits-of-local-food) underscores the advantages of consuming locally sourced food:

- **Full Flavor**: Local produce, harvested at peak ripeness, offers superior flavor compared to goods harvested early for shipping.


- **Nutrient Rich**: The short journey from farm to table means local foods are likely to have higher nutrient retention.


- **Boosts Local Economy**: Spending on local foods contributes significantly to the local economy. Research of local
  economic flows has demonstrated that the food system in
  Michigan [contributed $680 million to state earnings in 2011.](https://www.canr.msu.edu/cea/uploads/files/valuingmilocalfoodsystem.pdf)


- **Environmental Advantages**: Local sourcing minimizes the environmental footprint associated with long-distance transportation, supporting sustainability in agriculture.


- **Food Safety**: Reduced supply chain length enhances food safety by limiting contamination risks.


- **Direct Transparency**: The platform facilitates direct interactions between consumers and producers, offering deeper insight into food production methods.

Furthermore, [research](https://www.cals.iastate.edu/news/2022/research-shows-significant-environmental-benefits-local-food-production) from Iowa State University highlights that large-scale production model had significantly greater global warming potential in all stages of food production and
distribution than that of the medium- and small-scale production models.
Typical **local vegetable production** produces **less than half the emissions** and use 10% of the water than that of
conventional food systems.
