## Detailed Project Overview

This Kotlin-based web application serves as an advanced platform for posting and managing offers. It allows users to create, manage, and interact with a wide range of offers, while also providing functionalities for user authentication and profile management.

### Core Technologies and Frameworks

- **Kotlin**: Primary programming language
- **Ktor**: Asynchronous web framework used for building servers and clients in connected systems.
- **MongoDB**: For flexible and scalable data storage.
- **Google OAuth**: For secure authentication, integrating Google's reliable sign-in systems.
- **Koin**: Lightweight dependency injection framework.

### Architectural Patterns and Key Design Choices

- **Clean Architecture**: The application adheres to the principles of Clean Architecture, ensuring the separation of concerns and independence of different layers like data, domain, and presentation.
- **Repository Pattern**: This pattern is evident in classes like `CategoryRepositoryImpl` and `OfferRepositoryImpl`, providing a clean abstraction layer over data access mechanisms.
- **Factory Pattern**: Used in classes like `CategoryFactory`, simplifying object creation and enhancing flexibility.
- **Use Case/Interactor Pattern**: Each business logic operation is encapsulated in a use case (e.g., `CreateCategoryUseCase`, `GetUserOffersUseCase`), promoting a clean separation of concerns and making the code more readable and testable.

### Detailed Breakdown of Functionalities

1. **User Features**:
    - `UserRoute.kt` establishes endpoints for user-related actions.
    - `UserDataRepositoryImpl` implements data handling operations, interfacing with the database.
    - Use cases like `SaveUserUseCase` and `UpdateUserDataUseCase` encapsulate specific user-related operations.

2. **Offer Features**:
    - `OfferRoute.kt` sets up routes for managing offers.
    - `OfferRepositoryImpl` deals with offer data storage and retrieval.
    - Use cases such as `CreateOfferUseCase` and `UpdateOfferUseCase` handle individual aspects of offer management.

3. **Category Features**:
    - `CategoryRoute.kt` manages endpoints for category operations.
    - `CategoryService` and `CategoryRepository` provide business logic and data access functionalities.
    - Use cases like `CreateCategoryUseCase` and `DeleteCategoryUseCase` focus on specific category operations.

4. **Authentication and Security**:
    - `AuthRoute.kt` and `GoogleUserInfoServiceImpl` work together to provide secure authentication mechanisms.
    - Integration with Google OAuth ensures a reliable and secure sign-in process.

5. **Database Integration and Management**:
    - `MongoDatabaseProvider` orchestrates database connections and interactions, ensuring efficient data management.
    - Modular database configurations are managed through files like `DatabaseModule.kt`, enhancing scalability and maintainability.

### Sample Endpoints

- **User Registration**: `POST /users/register` - for user sign-up.
- **User Login**: `POST /users/login` - for user authentication.
- **Create Offer**: `POST /offers/create` - to post a new offer.
- **Get All Offers**: `GET /offers` - to retrieve all offers.
- **Update User Profile**: `PUT /users/{id}` - for updating user profiles.
